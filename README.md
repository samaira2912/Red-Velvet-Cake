The ingredients that make red velvet cake unique are cocoa powder, buttermilk, vinegar, baking soda, and red food coloring.

The chemical reaction among these ingredients helps give red velvet a natural deep maroon color, which is often enhanced with food coloring.

If you’re ever reading a red velvet recipe without those ingredients, run. Don’t make it.

For the fat, you want to use a neutral flavored oil such as vegetable or canola oil. Using all oil allows the tangy buttermilk flavor to shine while also making a moist cake.

I saw some recipes using butter. However, if you used butter, its flavor would overpower the buttermilk and vinegar.

Red velvet cake also uses whole eggs. I saw one recipe using only egg whites, which I thought was weird because red velvet cake is not a white cake.
